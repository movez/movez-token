    <meta name="description" content="MoveZ is based on a common everyday activity for most people: moving. We are the first team to create and implement a sustainable, working Move-to-Earn (M2E) model. By simply moving, jogging, walking, running, and swimming indoors and outdoors, users will earn IN-APP currency, which can either be donated to numerous charity organizations or cashed out for profit. MoveZ&#x27;s earn capability intends to incentivize tens of millions of people around the globe toward a healthier lifestyle, introducing them to how revolutionary the web3 can and will be, all while relying on its social elements and simple UI to develop a long-lasting platform encouraging user-generated Web 3.0 content. Note: MoveZ is currently being tested under its Closed Alpha Phase. The contents of this Litepaper may change in the future to better reflect the full scope of the project."/>
